# What is an atomic increment?

Why do we call ourselves Atomic Increment? One of the myriad ways of improving code performance is to use multithreaded code to lower latency. Every modern computer has many cores which can run one or more threads at the same time.

The "atomic increment" operation allows us to safely share a counter between two threads. Why is this necessary? This is because two CPUs running the same code increment a counter using these three operations:

- load from memory
- increment  
- store back to memory

If two threads are running, then we may get these following sequences:

## The good one:

```
    Processor 1               Processor 2
   |------------------------|------------------------|
   | load from memory       |                        |
   | increment              |                        |
   | store back to memory   |                        |
   |                        | load from memory       |
   |                        | increment              |
   |                        | store back to memory   |
   |------------------------|------------------------|
```

This adds 2 to the memory.

## And the bad one:

```
    Processor 1               Processor 2
   |------------------------|------------------------|
   | load from memory       |                        |
   |                        | load from memory       |
   | increment              |                        |
   |                        | increment              |
   |                        | store back to memory   |
   | store back to memory   |                        |
   |------------------------|------------------------|
```

The second sequence is bad because we only add 1 to the memory not 2! This is because Processor 1 overwrites the result of Processor 2 - a situation known as a "Race Condition".

To solve this we use special instructions that allow the CPUs to "lock" the memory while the increment occurs. How this is implemented depends on the CPU.
